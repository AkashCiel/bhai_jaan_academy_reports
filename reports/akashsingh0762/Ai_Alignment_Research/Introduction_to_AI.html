<h2>Key Concepts:</h2>
<h3>Basic Definition:</h3>
<p><p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong> AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. These machines can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions.</p></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong> A subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.</li>
<li><strong>Deep Learning (DL):</strong> A further subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to analyze various factors of data. It is particularly effective in processing large amounts of unstructured data.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Historical Context:</h3>
<p><p>AI has a rich history that dates back to ancient times, where myths and stories included mechanical beings. However, modern AI began in the mid-20th century. Notable milestones include:</p>
