You learned critical terms like **in-the-money (ITM)**, **out-of-the-money (OTM)**, and **at-the-money (ATM)**, essential for evaluating options.\n\nYour exploration of **How Options Work** solidified your understanding of the mechanics behind options, including the buying process, exercising options, and the significance of premiums. This knowledge is crucial for assessing the value of options in various trading scenarios.\n\n### Integrating Options Pricing Models\n\nThe topic of **Options Pricing Models** builds upon your existing knowledge by providing mathematical frameworks necessary for determining the fair value of options. Understanding these models is vital for informed decision-making and strategic planning in options trading. You learned about key models such as the Black-Scholes Model, which helps assess risk and informs trading strategies.\n\n### Understanding Leverage in Options\n\nAs you delved deeper, the concept of **leverage** emerged as a critical aspect. Leverage in options trading refers to the ability to amplify returns (or losses) by controlling a larger amount of an underlying asset with a relatively small investment. This understanding of leverage complements your grasp of options pricing, as both concepts interact in shaping trading strategies.\n\n### Risk and Reward in Options Trading\n\nThe balance between potential profits and losses is essential for making informed trading decisions. Understanding risk and reward underpins the strategies you will employ throughout your trading journey.\n\n### Basic Options Strategies\n\nBuilding on your foundational knowledge, **Basic Options Strategies** provide a practical framework for applying your understanding of options in real-world scenarios. These strategies can be categorized based on market outlook—bullish, bearish, or neutral—and serve to maximize returns or hedge against losses.\n\n#### a. Bullish Strategies\n\n- **Long Call**: Buying call options to profit from an anticipated increase in the underlying asset's price.\n\n### The Role of Time Decay\n\nA newly introduced concept, **time decay**, is vital for understanding options trading. Time decay, or **theta decay**, refers to the reduction in the value of an options contract as it approaches its expiration date. This concept is closely linked with options pricing and risk management, influencing the strategies you employ.\n\n#### Key Insights on Time Decay:\n\n1. **Definition and Importance**: Time decay reflects the loss of value in an option’s premium as it nears expiration. The rate of this decay is quantified by **theta**, one of the Greeks, which measures how much the option's price will decrease with the passage of time.\n   \n2. **Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Value**: Understanding the difference between intrinsic value (the actual value of the option) and extrinsic value (time value) is crucial. As expiration approaches, the extrinsic value diminishes, affecting the option's overall premium.\n\n3. **Influencing Factors**: Time to expiration",
