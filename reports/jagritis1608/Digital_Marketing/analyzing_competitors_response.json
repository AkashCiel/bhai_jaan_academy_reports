Understanding these factors can help businesses make informed decisions. \n\n- **Market Dynamics:** The structure of the market can influence competitive strategies. For instance, in a highly saturated market, companies may resort to price wars, whereas, in a niche market, differentiation becomes key.\n  \n- **Consumer Behavior:** Insights into consumer preferences can guide product development and marketing strategies.
