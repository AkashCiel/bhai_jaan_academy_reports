By the end, you will have a solid understanding of how different amplification techniques work and where they fit into the broader landscape of electronics.\n\n---\n\n## Key Concepts:\n\n### What is Signal Amplification?\n\n**Signal amplification** refers to the process of increasing the power, voltage, or current of a signal. The primary goal is to enhance weak signals to a level that can be effectively processed, transmitted, or utilized in various applications. Amplification is a critical step in many electronic systems, ensuring that information is accurately conveyed without degradation.\n\n### Basic Definitions:\n\n- **Gain**: The ratio of output power, voltage, or current to the input. It is a dimensionless value typically expressed in decibels (dB). For example, a gain of 20 dB corresponds to a tenfold increase in voltage.\n- **Linear Amplification**: A type of amplification where the output signal is a linear function of the input signal, meaning that the waveform shape remains unchanged.\n- **Nonlinear Amplification**: In this type, the output is not a linear function of the input, which can lead to distortion of the signal.\n\n### Types of Signal Amplifiers:\n\n1. **Voltage Amplifiers**: Increase the voltage level of a signal.\n2. **Current Amplifiers**: Increase the current level of a signal.\n3. **Power Amplifiers**: Boost the overall power of a signal, commonly used in audio and RF applications.\n\n---\n\n## Signal Amplification Techniques:\n\n### 1.
