The learning plan includes:\n\n1. **Introduction to Python**\n2. **Basic Syntax and Data Types**\n3. **Control Structures and Loops**\n4. **Functions**\n5. **Data Structures**\n6. **File Handling and Error Handling**\n7. **Libraries and Frameworks**\n\n## Basic Syntax and Data Types\n\nAs you continue your Python programming journey, we delve into the critical concepts of **Basic Syntax and Data Types**. These foundational elements are essential for writing effective Python code and understanding how to manipulate data within your programs.\n\n### 1. Basic Syntax\n\n**1.1. Writing Python Code:**\nPython employs a straightforward syntax that emphasizes readability. Key components include:\n- **Comments:** Document your code with comments using the hash symbol (`#`).\n  \n  ```python\n  # This is a comment\n  print(\"Hello, World!\")  # This prints a message to the console\n  ```\n\n- **Indentation:** Python uses indentation to define block scopes, making proper indentation crucial.\n\n  ```python\n  if True:\n      print(\"This is indented correctly.\")\n  ```\n\n- **Variables:** Variables store data without needing explicit type declarations due to Python's dynamic typing.\n\n  ```python\n  message = \"Hello, Python!\"\n  print(message)\n  ```\n\n**1.2. Expressions and Statements:**\n- **Expressions** are combinations of values and operators, while **statements** are executable instructions.\n\n### 2. Data Types\n\nPython supports several data types, categorized as follows:\n\n**2.1. Numeric Types:**\n- **Integers:** Whole numbers (e.g., `42`, `-10`).\n  \n  ```python\n  age = 30\n  ```\n\n- **Floating-Point Numbers:** Decimal numbers (e.g., `3.14`, `-0.001`).\n  \n  ```python\n  pi = 3.14\n  ```\n\n- **Complex Numbers:** Numbers with real and imaginary parts (e.g., `3 + 4j`).\n  \n  ```python\n  complex_number = 3 + 4j\n  ```\n\n**2.2. String Type:**\nStrings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes.\n\n```python\ngreeting = \"Hello, World!\"\n```\n\n**2.3. Boolean",
