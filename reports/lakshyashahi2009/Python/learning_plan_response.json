  "raw_response": "Here's a comprehensive 30-day learning plan for Python, divided into three expertise levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each level contains 10 topics that guide the learner through progressive concepts and skills.\n\n### Beginner Level (Days 1-10)\n\n1. **Introduction to Python**\n   - Overview of Python and its applications\n   - Installation and setup of Python environment\n\n2. **Basic Syntax and Data Types**\n   - Understanding variables, strings, integers, and floats\n   - Basic arithmetic operations\n\n3. **Control Structures**\n   - Conditional statements (if, else, elif)\n   - Logical operators\n\n4. **Loops**\n   - For loops and while loops\n   - Loop control statements (break, continue)\n\n5. **Functions**\n   - Defining and calling functions\n   - Understanding scope and return values\n\n6. **Lists and Tuples**\n   - Creating and manipulating lists\n   - Understanding tuples and their use cases\n\n7. **Dictionaries and Sets**\n   - Key-value pairs in dictionaries\n   - Set operations and their properties\n\n8. **File Handling**\n   - Reading from and writing to files\n   - Working with file objects\n\n9. **Error Handling**\n   - Introduction to exceptions\n   - Using try, except, finally blocks\n\n10. **Basic Libraries**\n    - Introduction to libraries (e.g., math, datetime)\n    - Importing and using libraries in Python\n\n### Intermediate Level (Days 11-20)\n\n1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**\n   - Understanding classes and objects\n   - Principles of inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism\n\n2. **Modules and Packages**\n   - Creating and using modules\n   - Understanding Python packages and the import system\n\n3. **List Comprehensions**\n   - Simplifying code with list comprehensions\n   - Conditional list comprehensions\n\n4. **Lambda Functions and Higher-Order Functions**\n   - Creating and using lambda functions\n   - Understanding map(), filter(), and reduce()\n\n5. **Regular Expressions**\n   - Introduction to regex and its applications\n   - Using the `re` module for pattern matching\n\n6. **Working with APIs**\n   - Introduction to REST APIs\n   - Making requests with the requests library\n\n7. **Data Handling with Pandas**\n   - Introduction to the Pandas library\n   - Data manipulation and analysis with DataFrames\n\n8. **Introduction to Web Development with Flask**\n   - Setting up a basic Flask application\n   - Routing and handling requests\n\n9. **Testing and Debugging**\n   - Writing unit tests with the unittest module\n   - Debugging techniques and tools\n\n10. **Virtual Environments**\n    - Creating and managing virtual environments\n    - Using pip for package management\n\n### Advanced Level (Days 21-30)\n\n1. **Advanced OOP Concepts**\n   - Understanding metaclasses and decorators\n   - Class methods and static methods\n\n2. **Concurrency and Parallelism**\n   - Introduction to threading and multiprocessing\n   - Using asyncio for asynchronous programming\n\n3. **Data Visualization**\n   - Using Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization\n   - Creating plots and visualizing data insights\n\n4. **Web Scraping**\n   - Introduction to web scraping with Beautiful Soup\n   - Handling HTML and extracting data\n\n5. **Database Interaction**\n   - Working with SQL databases using SQLite\n   - Using ORM with SQLAlchemy\n\n6. **Building RESTful APIs**\n   - Advanced concepts in Flask for API development\n   - Authentication and authorization techniques\n\n7. **Deployment and CI/CD**\n   - Introduction to deploying applications on cloud platforms\n   - Setting up continuous integration and delivery pipelines\n\n8. **Machine Learning Basics**\n   - Overview of machine learning concepts\n   - Introduction to scikit-learn and building simple models\n\n9. **Testing in Depth**\n   - Advanced testing techniques (mocking, integration tests)\n   - Test-driven development (TDD)\n\n10. **Best Practices and Design Patterns**\n    - Writing clean and maintainable code\n    - Common design patterns in Python\n\nThis 30-day plan allows learners to progress through the basics of Python to more complex and advanced topics, building a strong foundation for further exploration and expertise in programming.",
