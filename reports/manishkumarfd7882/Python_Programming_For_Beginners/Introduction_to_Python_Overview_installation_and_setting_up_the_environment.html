<li>
</ul>
<p><p>Click on the "Downloads" section. The website should automatically suggest the best version for your operating system.</p></p>
<p></li></p>
<ul>
<li>
</ul>
<p><p><strong>Run the Installer</strong>:</p></p>
<p></li></p>
<ul>
<li>Open the downloaded installer file.</li>
<li>
</ul>
<p><p>Ensure to check the box that says <strong>Add Python to PATH</strong> before clicking "Install Now". This step is crucial as it allows you to run Python from the command line.</p></p>
<p></li></p>
<ul>
<li>
</ul>
<p><p><strong>Verify Installation</strong>:</p></p>
<p></li></p>
<ul>
<li>After installation, open the command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).</li>
<li>
</ul>
<p><p>Type <code>python --version</code> or <code>python3 --version</code> (for macOS/Linux) to confirm that Python has been installed correctly.</p></p>
<p></li></p>
<ul>
<li>
</ul>
<p><p><strong>Install a Code Editor or IDE</strong>:</p></p>
<p></li></p>
<ul>
<li>
</ul>
<p><p>While you can use any text editor, a dedicated IDE can enhance your coding experience. Some popular choices include:</p></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>PyCharm</strong>: A powerful IDE with extensive features for professional developers.</li>
<li><strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>: A lightweight editor with many extensions that support Python development.</li>
