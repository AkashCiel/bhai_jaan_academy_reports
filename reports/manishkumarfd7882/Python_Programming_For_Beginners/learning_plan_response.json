  "raw_response": "Hereâ€™s a comprehensive 30-day learning plan for Python Programming, structured by expertise levels. This plan assumes approximately 1 day per topic for beginners, with more depth and complexity added in intermediate and advanced levels.\n\n### Beginner Level (Days 1-10)\n1. **Introduction to Python**: Overview, installation, and setting up the environment.\n2. **Basic Syntax**: Understanding indentation, comments, and basic statements.\n3. **Variables and Data Types**: Working with integers, floats, strings, and booleans.\n4. **Operators**: Arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.\n5. **Control Structures**: if statements, else, and elif.\n6. **Loops**: Introduction to for and while loops.\n7. **Functions**: Defining and calling functions, parameters, and return values.\n8. **Lists**: Creating, accessing, and manipulating lists.\n9. **Dictionaries**: Understanding key-value pairs, and basic operations.\n10. **Basic Input/Output**: Using input() and print() functions.\n\n### Intermediate Level (Days 11-20)\n1. **Error Handling**: Try, except blocks, and managing exceptions.\n2. **File Handling**: Reading from and writing to files.\n3. **Modules and Packages**: Importing libraries and creating your own modules.\n4. **List Comprehensions**: A more Pythonic way to create lists.\n5. **Lambda Functions**: Understanding anonymous functions in Python.\n6. **Regular Expressions**: Basics of pattern matching with regex.\n7. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, objects, methods, and inheritance.\n8. **Decorators**: Understanding how to modify functions with decorators.\n9. **Iterators and Generators**: Creating custom iterators and generators.\n10. **Basic Data Visualization**: Using libraries like Matplotlib for simple plots.\n\n### Advanced Level (Days 21-30)\n1. **Advanced OOP Concepts**: Polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstract classes.\n2. **Multi-threading and Multi-processing**: Basics of concurrent execution.\n3. **Networking**: Understanding sockets and basic client-server model.\n4. **Web Scraping**: Using BeautifulSoup and requests for extracting data from websites.\n5. **APIs**: Understanding RESTful APIs and how to interact with them using requests.\n6. **Testing and Debugging**: Using unittest and debugging techniques.\n7. **Data Structures**: Understanding stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees.\n8. **Databases**: Introduction to SQL and using SQLite with Python.\n9. **Frameworks**: Introduction to Flask or Django for web development.\n10. **Project**: Building a complete application that incorporates learned concepts.\n\nThis 30-day learning plan should provide a well-rounded foundation in Python programming, progressing from basic concepts to more advanced topics, suitable for a beginner seeking to become proficient in Python.",
