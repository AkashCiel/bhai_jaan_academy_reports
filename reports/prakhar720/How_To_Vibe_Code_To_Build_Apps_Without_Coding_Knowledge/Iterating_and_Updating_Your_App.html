<p></li></p>
<ul>
<li>
</ul>
<p><p><strong>Test Updates:</strong></p></p>
<p></li></p>
<ul>
<li>After changes are made, conduct testing to ensure that the updates work as intended and do not introduce new issues.</li>
<li>
</ul>
<p><p>Consider A/B testing to compare the new version with the previous one.</p></p>
<p></li></p>
<ul>
<li>
</ul>
<p><p><strong>Launch Update:</strong></p></p>
<p></li></p>
<ul>
<li>Once testing is complete and the updates are verified, launch the new version of your app.</li>
<li>
</ul>
<p><p>Communicate the changes to your users, highlighting new features or improvements.</p></p>
