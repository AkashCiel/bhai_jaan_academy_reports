<h2>Real-World Applications:</h2>
<h3>1. Navigating Local Markets</h3>
<p><p>Imagine you find yourself at a bustling <strong>시장에서 (sijangeseo)</strong> (market) in Seoul filled with colorful stalls. You are eager to buy some local produce, but you need to use your shopping vocabulary to communicate effectively. </p></p>

<p></li></p>
<ul>
<li>
</ul>
<p><p>If you think the price is high, you might try to negotiate by saying, <strong>좀 깎아 주세요. (Jom kkakka juseyo.)</strong> (Please lower the price a bit.).

<ul>
<li>
</ul>
<p><p>After trying on a few items, you may decide to purchase them. At the checkout, you can ask for your <strong>영수증 (yeongsujeung)</strong> (receipt) to keep track of your expenses.</p></p>
<p></li></p>
</ul>
<h3>3. Online Shopping</h3>
<p><p>In today’s digital age, online shopping has become a norm. Familiarizing yourself with shopping vocabulary can enhance your online experiences, especially in navigating Korean websites:</p></p>
