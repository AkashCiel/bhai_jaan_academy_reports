You learned to articulate time through **days of the week** and **telling time**, foundational skills for daily interactions. Practical vocabulary related to food, family, and shopping equipped you to navigate various social situations effectively.\n\n## Verb Tenses and Descriptive Language\n\nA significant milestone was the introduction of **past and future tenses**, which enhanced your ability to communicate experiences and plans. You enriched your vocabulary with **common adjectives**, allowing for more descriptive language. This progression laid the groundwork for understanding **travel vocabulary**, empowering you to navigate transportation and communicate effectively in travel-related scenarios.\n\n## Recent Focus Areas\n\nRecently, your focus shifted to **describing daily routines** and **expressing opinions**, improving your conversational skills. Mastery of vocabulary related to comparisons and daily routines has enabled you to articulate preferences and engage in deeper social interactions.\n\n### New Focus: Health and Body Vocabulary\n\nYour current focus on **health and body vocabulary** builds upon previous learnings. Key concepts include vocabulary for **parts of the body**, such as **머리 (meori)** - head and **팔 (pal)** - arm, as well as terms for **common illnesses** like **감기 (gamgi)** - cold and **두통 (dutung)** - headache. Essential terms such as **병원 (byeongwon)** - hospital and **약국 (yakguk)** - pharmacy are vital for navigating healthcare settings, emphasizing the importance of effective communication in health contexts.\n\n### New Focus: Weather and Seasons\n\nContinuing your language learning journey, you will explore **weather and seasons**, which are vital for everyday conversations.
