          <h1>Judicial Review of Parliamentary Legislation</h1>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p><p>Building upon our previous exploration of the Indian parliamentary democracy, we now turn our attention to a pivotal aspect of constitutional law: <strong>judicial review of parliamentary legislation.</strong> This concept serves as a critical check on the powers of both Parliament and the executive, ensuring that laws passed adhere to the Constitution of India. Understanding judicial review is essential for grasping how the judiciary interacts with legislative processes and civil rights, thus reinforcing the principles of accountability and transparency that we have previously discussed.</p></p>
<p><p>Judicial review embodies the power of courts to evaluate the constitutionality of legislative acts, offering a balance between the authority of Parliament and the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. This report will delve into the theoretical foundations of judicial review, its practical implications, and real-world applications, particularly within the Indian context. We will also discuss emerging trends and future directions, ultimately framing judicial review as a dynamic and evolving aspect of democratic governance.</p></p>
<hr />
<h2>Key Concepts:</h2>
<h3>1. Understanding Judicial Review</h3>
<p><p><strong>Judicial Review</strong> refers to the power of the judiciary to examine legislative and executive actions to ensure their compliance with the Constitution. This process empowers courts to invalidate laws that contravene constitutional provisions, thereby protecting individual rights and maintaining the rule of law.</p></p>
<h3>2. Historical Context</h3>
<p><p>The concept of judicial review in India is influenced by global practices, particularly the American model, where the Supreme Court has the authority to strike down laws deemed unconstitutional. This mechanism was formally established in India through landmark cases such as <strong>Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973)</strong>, which articulated the <strong>basic structure doctrine</strong>, asserting that certain fundamental features of the Constitution cannot be altered or destroyed by amendments.</p></p>
<h3>3. The Constitutional Basis</h3>
<p><p>The Constitution of India does not explicitly mention judicial review, but it is implied through several articles, notably:</p></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Article 13</strong>: Prohibits laws that infringe upon fundamental rights.</li>
<li><strong>Article 32</strong>: Allows individuals to approach the Supreme Court for the enforcement of their rights.</li>
<li><strong>Article 246</strong>: Outlines the distribution of legislative powers between the Parliament and state legislatures.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>4. The Role of the Supreme Court and High Courts</h3>
<p><p>The <strong>Supreme Court of India</strong> serves as the apex judicial authority, with the power to review laws passed by Parliament and state legislatures. High Courts also possess similar powers but within their respective jurisdictions. The judiciary plays a critical role in interpreting laws and ensuring that legislative actions remain within constitutional bounds.</p></p>
<hr />
<h2>Theoretical Foundations of Judicial Review</h2>
<h3>1. The Doctrine of Separation of Powers</h3>
<p><p>The doctrine of separation of powers is foundational to the concept of judicial review. It delineates the functions of the legislature, executive, and judiciary, ensuring that no branch exceeds its authority. Judicial review acts as a mechanism to maintain this balance, preventing potential abuses of power by the legislature.</p></p>
<h3>2. The Basic Structure Doctrine</h3>
<p><p>As mentioned earlier, the <strong>basic structure doctrine</strong> emerged from the <strong>Kesavananda Bharati</strong> case, establishing that certain constitutional principlesâ€”such as the supremacy of the Constitution, rule of law, and separation of powersâ€”cannot be altered by amendments. This doctrine emphasizes that while Parliament can legislate, it cannot alter the foundational framework of the Constitution.</p></p>
<h3>3. The Role of Precedents</h3>
<p><p>Judicial review relies heavily on precedentsâ€”previous court decisions that guide current cases. Landmark rulings contribute to the evolving landscape of judicial review, shaping its application and reinforcing constitutional values. For instance, the <strong>Minerva Mills case (1980)</strong> reaffirmed the basic structure doctrine, emphasizing judicial scrutiny of parliamentary legislation.</p></p>
<hr />
<h2>Practical Implications</h2>
<h3>1. Protecting Fundamental Rights</h3>
<p><p>Judicial review plays a crucial role in safeguarding fundamental rights. By scrutinizing legislation that may infringe upon these rights, the judiciary ensures that citizens are protected from arbitrary actions by the state. For example, the <strong>Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978)</strong> case expanded the interpretation of Article 21, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty.</p></p>
<h3>2. Legislative Accountability</h3>
<p><p>Judicial review enhances legislative accountability by compelling lawmakers to adhere to constitutional mandates. When laws are challenged in court, it prompts a reevaluation of the legislative process and encourages a more transparent and inclusive approach to lawmaking.</p></p>
<h3>3. Case Studies of Judicial Review in Action</h3>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shayara Bano v. Union of India (2017)</strong>: The Supreme Court declared the practice of instant triple talaq unconstitutional, highlighting the judiciary's role in protecting women's rights and promoting gender justice.</li>
<li><strong>Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India (2018)</strong>: The decriminalization of Section 377, which criminalized consensual same-sex relations, underscored the judiciary's commitment to equality and individual rights.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Current State of Judicial Review in India</h2>
<h3>1. Recent Developments</h3>
<p><p>In recent years, judicial review has been at the forefront of several high-profile cases, reflecting the judiciary's proactive stance on safeguarding constitutional principles. The Supreme Court has taken on contentious issues, such as the <strong>Ayodhya land dispute</strong>, while navigating the delicate balance between law and public sentiment.</p></p>
<h3>2. Critiques and Challenges</h3>
<p><p>Despite its significance, judicial review faces critiques regarding judicial activism and overreach. Critics argue that the judiciary sometimes encroaches upon legislative functions, leading to tensions between the branches of government. However, proponents assert that judicial review is essential for maintaining checks and balances in a democratic society.</p></p>
<hr />
<h2>Future Directions</h2>
<h3>1. Evolving Nature of Judicial Review</h3>
<p><p>The landscape of judicial review is continually evolving, influenced by social movements, technological advancements, and changing public sentiments. The judiciary's responsiveness to societal needs is crucial in adapting the application of judicial review to contemporary challenges.</p></p>
<h3>2. Role of Technology</h3>
<p><p>Advancements in technology, particularly in data privacy and cybersecurity, present new dimensions for judicial review. As legislative frameworks evolve to address these issues, the judiciary will play a vital role in scrutinizing laws that impact individual rights and freedoms in the digital age.</p></p>
<h3>3. Global Perspectives</h3>
<p><p>Examining judicial review practices in other democracies can provide valuable insights. Countries like the United States and South Africa have unique approaches to judicial review that can inform India's evolving legal landscape. Comparative analysis can shed light on best practices and potential pitfalls.</p></p>
<hr />
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><p>Judicial review of parliamentary legislation is a cornerstone of constitutional democracy, embodying the principles of accountability, transparency, and protection of fundamental rights. By examining its historical foundations, theoretical frameworks, and practical implications, we recognize the judiciary's critical role in maintaining the balance of power within the Indian parliamentary system.</p></p>
<p><p>As we navigate an increasingly complex legal landscape, understanding judicial review will empower citizens to engage meaningfully with their rights and responsibilities. It is imperative to remain vigilant and informed about the evolving nature of judicial review, as it will continue to shape the future of governance in India.</p></p>
<h3>Call to Action</h3>
<p><p>To deepen your understanding of judicial review, consider exploring landmark Supreme Court cases or engaging in discussions about contemporary legal challenges. The more informed we are as citizens, the better we can advocate for our rights and contribute to a robust democratic society.</p></p>
