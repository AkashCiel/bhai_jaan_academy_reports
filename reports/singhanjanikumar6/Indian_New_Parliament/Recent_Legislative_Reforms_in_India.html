<h3>2. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019</h3>
<p><p>The CAA was enacted to provide a pathway to Indian citizenship for non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan who entered India before December 31, 2014. It marked a significant shift in India's citizenship policy, with implications for secularism and minority rights.</p></p>
<h4>Key Aspects:</h4>

</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Real-World Applications:</h4>
<p><p>The CAA has sparked nationwide debates about national identity, secularism, and human rights. It has brought civil society to the forefront, showcasing the need for advocacy and public discourse in shaping legislative outcomes.</p></p>
<h3>3. The Farm Laws Repeal Act, 2021</h3>
<p><p>The Farm Laws Repeal Act is significant as it rescinded three controversial farm laws that aimed to deregulate the agricultural market. Farmers argued that these laws favored large corporations over small farmers.</p></p>
<h4>Key Aspects:</h4>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protest Movement:</strong> The passing of the original laws led to massive protests by farmers across India, highlighting the power of grassroots movements in influencing legislation.</li>

<h4>Key Aspects:</h4>

<li><strong>Civil Society Advocacy:</strong> Numerous civil society organizations campaigned against the amendments, emphasizing the importance of RTI in a democratic society.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Real-World Applications:</h4>
<p><p>The changes to the RTI Act reflect ongoing tensions between government transparency and bureaucratic control. Civil society's role in advocating for RTI underscores the importance of citizen engagement in legislative processes.</p></p>
<h3>5. The Labour Codes (2020)</h3>
<p><p>The Labour Codes consolidated various labour laws into four codes, aimed at simplifying compliance for businesses and enhancing worker rights.</p></p>
<h4>Key Aspects:</h4>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on Flexibility:</strong> Critics argue that these changes may lead to reduced job security and benefits for workers, while proponents claim they enhance ease of doing business.</li>
<li><strong>Stakeholder Involvement:</strong> The implementation of these codes involved consultations with various stakeholders, including trade unions and industry bodies.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Real-World Applications:</h4>
<p><p>The Labour Codes demonstrate the need for balancing economic growth with social welfare. Civil society's engagement in dialogues regarding these codes is critical to ensuring fair labour practices.</p></p>
<h3>6. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment), 2021</h3>
<p><p>This amendment aimed to streamline the insolvency process, making it more efficient and user-friendly for businesses facing financial distress.</p></p>
<h4>Key Aspects:</h4>
