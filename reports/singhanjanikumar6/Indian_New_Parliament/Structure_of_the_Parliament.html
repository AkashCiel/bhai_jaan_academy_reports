          <h1>Educational Report on the Structure of the Parliament</h1>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p><p>Building upon your initial exploration of the Indian Parliament, we now delve deeper into the <strong>structure of the Parliament</strong>, a critical aspect that underpins its functioning and efficacy in representing democratic values. Understanding the structure is essential, as it not only defines how the Parliament operates but also illuminates the relationships and dynamics among its members and functions.</p></p>
<p><p>The Indian Parliament, as previously discussed, is a bicameral institution composed of the <strong>Lok Sabha</strong> (House of the People) and the <strong>Rajya Sabha</strong> (Council of States). In this report, we will explore the intricate details of this structure, including the composition, roles, and functions of both houses, the significance of the President of India within this framework, and the implications of these structures on the functioning of democracy in India.</p></p>
<h3>Key Concepts of Parliamentary Structure:</h3>
