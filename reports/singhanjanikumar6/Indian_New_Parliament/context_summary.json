Structure of the Indian Parliament\n\nBuilding on your initial insights, the recent report delves deeper into the **structure of the Indian Parliament**, which comprises two houses: the **Lok Sabha** (House of the People) and the **Rajya Sabha** (Council of States). This bicameral framework is essential for ensuring a balance of power and representation in the legislative process.\n\n#### Lok Sabha:\n- **Composition**: The Lok Sabha consists of a maximum of 552 members, including 530 elected from states and 20 from Union Territories. Members serve a five-year term unless dissolved earlier.\n- **Roles**: It primarily handles legislation, financial control, and representation of constituents. The Lok Sabha’s power to introduce money bills is particularly significant for budgetary processes.\n- **Leadership**: The Speaker of the Lok Sabha plays a crucial role in maintaining order and facilitating debates.\n\n#### Rajya Sabha:\n- **Composition**: Comprising 245 members, with 233 elected by State Legislative Assemblies and 12 appointed by the President for their expertise. Members serve six-year terms, with one-third retiring every two years.\n- **Roles**: The Rajya Sabha reviews and amends legislation proposed by the Lok Sabha and represents state interests at the national level.\n- **Leadership**: The Vice President of India serves as the Chairman, overseeing the proceedings.\n\n### 2.

This role is crucial for maintaining the legislative process and ensuring that parliamentary democracy operates smoothly.\n\n### 3. Committees in Parliament\n\nBoth houses have various committees that scrutinize legislation, ensuring thorough examination before laws are passed. Committees also enhance representation by allowing diverse voices to contribute to discussions on specific issues, leading to informed decision-making.\n\n### 4. Working Mechanism of Parliament\n\nUnderstanding the legislative process is vital.
