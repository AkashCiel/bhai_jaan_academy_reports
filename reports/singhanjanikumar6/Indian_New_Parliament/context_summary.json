Structure of the Indian Parliament\n\nThe Indian Parliament is a bicameral legislature composed of two houses: the **Lok Sabha** and the **Rajya Sabha**. This structure ensures a balance of power and representation.\n\n- **Lok Sabha**: With a maximum of 552 members, this house focuses on legislation, financial oversight, and serving constituents. The Speaker plays a critical role in facilitating discussions and maintaining order.\n  \n- **Rajya Sabha**: Comprising 245 members, the Rajya Sabha reviews and amends legislation proposed by the Lok Sabha while representing state interests, overseen by the Vice President.\n\n### 2. Role of the President of India\n\nBuilding upon your understanding of Parliament, the **President of India** serves as a ceremonial head of state and a key player in the legislative process. The President's role is multifaceted, encompassing constitutional authority, legislative functions, and a ceremonial presence that embodies the unity of the nation.\n\n#### Key Functions of the President:\n\n- **Constitutional Authority**: As the constitutional head of the executive branch, the President represents the nation and ensures that constitutional provisions are upheld.\n  \n- **Legislative Functions**: The President summons and prorogues sessions of Parliament, addresses both Houses, and grants assent to bills, playing a crucial role in the legislative process.\n\n- **Judicial Role**: The President has the authority to grant pardons and reprieves, influencing judicial outcomes.\n\n### 3.
