<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p><p>Building upon your previous learning about Yog, particularly the <strong>Eight Limbs of Yoga</strong>, we now turn our focus to one of the most essential components of practice: <strong>Asanas</strong> or physical postures.

We will delve into their benefits, practical applications, and how they fit into the broader framework of Yog. By the end, you will have a comprehensive understanding of these foundational poses and their importance in a holistic Yog practice.</p></p>
