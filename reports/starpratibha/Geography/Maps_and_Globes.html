<h4>Maps:</h4>
<p><p>A <strong>map</strong> is a two-dimensional representation of a geographic area. It depicts various features such as landforms, roads, boundaries, and amenities. Maps can be used for navigation, data visualization, and analysis. They represent spatial relationships on a flat surface, which involves a process called <strong>projection</strong>. </p></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Projection</strong>: This is the method by which the curved surface of the Earth is represented on a flat map. Different projections emphasize different aspects of geographic data, such as area, shape, distance, or direction.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Globes:</h4>
<p><p>A <strong>globe</strong> is a three-dimensional spherical representation of Earth. It accurately represents geographic features and relationships without the distortions that occur on flat maps. Globes provide a more realistic view of the world, including the curvature of the Earth and the relative sizes of continents and oceans.</p></p>
<h3>Types of Maps:</h3>
<p><p>Maps can be classified into various categories based on their purpose and the information they convey. Here are some common types:</p></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Topographic Maps</strong>: These maps use contour lines to represent elevation and landforms, showing both natural and human-made features.</li>
<li><strong>Political Maps</strong>: These maps display governmental boundaries, such as countries, states, and municipalities, along with major cities.</li>
<li><strong>Physical Maps</strong>: These maps focus on natural features like mountains, rivers, and forests, often using color gradients to indicate elevation.</li>
<li><strong>Thematic Maps</strong>: These maps emphasize a specific theme or subject, such as population density, climate zones, or economic indicators.</li>
<li><strong>Navigational Maps</strong>: Used for travel, these maps provide information for finding routes, including highways and airways.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Key Terms and Definitions:</h3>
<p><p>Here are some essential terms related to maps and globes:</p></p>
