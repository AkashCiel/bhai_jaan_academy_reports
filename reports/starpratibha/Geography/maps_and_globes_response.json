It depicts various features such as landforms, roads, boundaries, and amenities. Maps can be used for navigation, data visualization, and analysis. They represent spatial relationships on a flat surface, which involves a process called **projection**. \n\n- **Projection**: This is the method by which the curved surface of the Earth is represented on a flat map. Different projections emphasize different aspects of geographic data, such as area, shape, distance, or direction.\n\n#### Globes:\nA **globe** is a three-dimensional spherical representation of Earth. It accurately represents geographic features and relationships without the distortions that occur on flat maps. Globes provide a more realistic view of the world, including the curvature of the Earth and the relative sizes of continents and oceans.\n\n### Types of Maps:\n\nMaps can be classified into various categories based on their purpose and the information they convey. Here are some common types:\n\n- **Topographic Maps**: These maps use contour lines to represent elevation and landforms, showing both natural and human-made features.\n- **Political Maps**: These maps display governmental boundaries, such as countries, states, and municipalities, along with major cities.\n- **Physical Maps**: These maps focus on natural features like mountains, rivers, and forests, often using color gradients to indicate elevation.\n- **Thematic Maps**: These maps emphasize a specific theme or subject, such as population density, climate zones, or economic indicators.\n- **Navigational Maps**: Used for travel, these maps provide information for finding routes, including highways and airways.\n\n### Key Terms and Definitions:\nHere are some essential terms related to maps and globes:\n\n- **Scale**: The ratio between distances on a map and the actual distances on the ground. A larger scale (e.g., 1:10,000) shows more detail, while a smaller scale (e.g., 1:1,000,000) covers a larger area but with less detail.\n- **Legend (or Key)**: A guide that explains the symbols and colors used on a map, allowing users to interpret the information accurately.\n- **Latitude and Longitude**: A coordinate system that helps pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude lines run horizontally and measure distance north or south of the Equator, while longitude lines run vertically and measure distance east or west of the Prime Meridian.\n- **Cartography**: The art and science of map-making, encompassing aspects of design, data visualization, and geographic analysis.\n\n---\n\n## Real-World Applications:\n\nMaps and globes have numerous practical applications that impact our daily lives, from navigation to education.
